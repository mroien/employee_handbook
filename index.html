                            TAP|QA, LLC provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants
                            for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation,

                            amnesty or status as a covered veteran in accordance with applicable federal, state and
                            local laws. TAP|QA, LLC complies with applicable state and local laws governing

                        &lt;/article&gt;

                        &lt;h3 id="anti-harass"&gt;Tap|QA, LLC's Anti-harassment Policy and Complaint Procedure&lt;/h3&gt;
                        &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                            TAP/QA, LLC is committed to a work environment in which all individuals are treated with
                            respect and dignity. Each individual has the right to work in a professional atmosphere that
                            promotes equal employment opportunities and prohibits unlawful discriminatory practices,
                            including harassment. Therefore, TAP/QA, LLC expects that all relationships among persons
                            in the o ce and at client sites will be business-like and free of bias, prejudice and harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;It is the policy of TAP|QA, LLC to ensure equal employment opportunity without discrimination
                            or harassment on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender
                            identity, national origin, age, disability, genetic information, marital status, amnesty or
                            status as a covered veteran. TAP|QA, LLC prohibits any such discrimination or harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;TAP/QA, LLC encourages reporting of all perceived incidents of discrimination or harassment.
                            It is the policy of TAP/QA, LLC to promptly and thoroughly investigate such reports. TAP/QA,
                            LLC prohibits retaliation against any individual who reports discrimination or harassment or
                            who participates in an investigation of such reports.&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;/article&gt;

                        &lt;h3 id="harassment"&gt;Definitions of Harassment&lt;/h3&gt;
                        &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                            Sexual harassment constitutes discrimination and is illegal under federal, state and local laws.
                            For the purposes of this policy, sexual harassment is defined, as in the Equal Employment
                            Commission Guidelines, as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and other
                            verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when, for example a) submission to such conduct
                            is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual’s employment;
                            b) submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for
                            employment decisions affecting such individual; or c) such conduct has the purpose or effect
                            of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating,
                            hostile or offensive working environment. &lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;Sexual harassment may include a range of subtle and not-so-subtle behaviors and may
                            involve individuals of the same or different gender. Depending on the circumstances,
                            these behaviors may include unwanted sexual advances or requests for sexual favors; sexual
                            jokes and innuendo; verbal abuse of a sexual nature; commentary about an individual’s
                            body, sexual prowess or sexual deficiencies; leering, whistling or touching; insulting
                            or obscene comments or gestures; display in the workplace of sexually suggestive objects
                            or pictures; and other physical, verbal or visual conduct of a sexual nature. &lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;Harassment on the basis of any other protected characteristic is also
                            strictly prohibited. Under this policy, harassment is verbal, written or physical conduct
                            that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual because of his/her
                            race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, age, disability,
                            marital status, citizenship, genetic information or any other characteristic protected by
                            law or that of his/her relatives, friends or associates, and that a) has the purpose or
                            effect of creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment; b) has the
                            purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s work performance;
                            or c) otherwise adversely affects an individual’s employment opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;Harassing conduct includes epithets, slurs or negative stereotyping; threatening,
                            intimidating or hostile acts; denigrating jokes; and written or graphic material
                            that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual or group and that
                            is placed on walls or elsewhere on the employer’s premises or circulated in the
                            workplace, on company time or using company equipment via e-mail, phone
                            (including voice messages), text messages, tweets, blogs, social networking sites or other means.&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;/article&gt;

                        &lt;h3 id="conduct"&gt;Individuals and Conduct Covered&lt;/h3&gt;
                        &lt;article&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;
                            These policies apply to all applicants and employees, whether related to conduct engaged
                            in by fellow employees or someone not directly connected to TAP/QA, LLC (e.g., an outside
                            vendor, consultant or customer).&lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;Conduct prohibited by these policies is unacceptable in
                            the workplace and in any work-related setting outside the workplace, such as during
                            business trips, business meetings and business-related social events.
                            &lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;/article&gt;

                        &lt;h3 id="complaint"&gt;Complaint Process&lt;/h3&gt;
                        &lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                            Individuals who believe they have been the victims of conduct prohibited by this policy
                            statement or who believe they have witnessed such conduct should discuss their concerns
                            with their immediate supervisor, Human Resources or any member of management.&lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;When possible, TAP/QA, LLC encourages individuals who believe they are being subjected to
                            such conduct to promptly advise the offender that his or her behavior is unwelcome and
                            request that it be discontinued. Often, this action alone will resolve the problem.
                            TAP/QA, LLC recognizes, however, that an individual may prefer to pursue the matter
                            through complaint procedures. &lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;TAP|QA, LLC encourages the prompt reporting of complaints or concerns so that rapid
                            and constructive action can be taken before relationships become irreparably strained.
                            Therefore, although no  xed reporting period has been established, early reporting and
                            intervention have proven to be the most effective
                            method of resolving actual or perceived incidents of harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;Any reported allegations of harassment, discrimination or retaliation will be investigated promptly.
                            The investigation may include individual interviews with the parties involved and,
                            where necessary, with individuals who may have observed the alleged conduct or may have
                            other relevant knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;Confidentiality will be maintained throughout the investigatory
                            process to the extent consistent with adequate investigation and appropriate corrective action.&lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;Retaliation against an individual for reporting harassment or discrimination or for
                            participating in an investigation of a claim of harassment or discrimination is a serious
                            violation of this policy and, like harassment or discrimination itself, will be subject
                            to disciplinary action. Acts of retaliation should be reported immediately and will be
                            promptly investigated and addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;Misconduct constituting harassment, discrimination or retaliation will be dealt with
                            appropriately. &lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;False and malicious complaints of harassment, discrimination or
                            retaliation may be the subject of appropriate disciplinary action.&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;/article&gt;

                            are federal laws that prohibit employers with 15 or more employees from discriminating
                            against applicants and individuals with disabilities and that, when needed, provide
                            reasonable accommodations to applicants and employees who are qualified for a job, with
                            or without reasonable accommodations, so that they may perform the essential job duties of the position.
                            &lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;It is the policy of TAP/QA, LLC to comply with all federal and state laws concerning
                            the employment of persons with disabilities and to act in accordance with regulations

                            it is our company policy not to discriminate against qualified individuals with disabilities
                            in regard to application procedures, hiring, advancement, discharge, compensation, training
                            or other terms, conditions and privileges of employment.&lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;The company will reasonably
                            accommodate qualified individuals with a disability so that they can perform the essential
                            functions of a job, unless doing so causes a direct threat to these individuals or others
                            in the workplace and the threat cannot be eliminated by reasonable accommodation and/or
                            if the accommodation creates an undue hardship to TAP/QA, LLC. Contact Human Resources

                                a copy of the report will be provided to the applicant, and the applicant will have the
                                opportunity to dispute the report’s accuracy. Background checks may include a criminal
                                record check, although a criminal conviction does not automatically bar an applicant
                                from employment.
                            &lt;/p&gt;

                                Additional checks such as a driving record, education, or credit report may be made
                                on applicants for particular client sites and contracts.
                            &lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;
                                TAP|QA, LLC also reserves the right to conduct a background check for current
                                employees to determine eligibility for promotion or reassignment in the same manner
                                as described above.
                            &lt;/p&gt;

                                Every employee has the duty and the responsibility to be aware of and abide by
                                existing rules and policies. Employees also have the responsibility to perform his/ her
                                duties to the best of his/her ability and to the standards as set forth in his/her

                                TAP|QA, LLC supports the use of progressive discipline to address issues such as
                                poor work performance or misconduct. Our progressive discipline policy is designed
                                to provide a corrective action process to improve and prevent a recurrence of
                                undesirable behavior and/or performance issues. Our progressive discipline policy
                                has been designed consistent with our organizational values, Human Resources best
                                practices and employment laws.
                            &lt;/p&gt;

                                Outlined below are the steps of our progressive discipline policy and procedure.
                                TAP|QA, LLC reserves the right to combine or skip steps in this process depending
                                on the facts of each situation and the nature of the offense. The level of disciplinary
                                intervention may also vary. Some of the factors that will be considered are as
                                follows: whether the offense is repeated despite coaching, counseling and/or training;
                                employee’s work record; and the impact the conduct and performance issues have
                                on the organization.
                            &lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;
                                The following outlines TAP|QA, LLC’s progressive discipline process:
                            &lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;ul&gt;
                                &lt;li&gt;
                                Verbal warning: A supervisor verbally counsels an employee about an issue of
                                concern, and a written record of the discussion is placed in the employee’s personnel
                                file for future reference.
                                &lt;/li&gt;
                                &lt;li&gt;
                                Written warning: Written warnings are used for behavior or violations that a
                                supervisor considers serious or in situations when a verbal warning has not helped
                                change unacceptable behavior. Written warnings are placed in an employee’s personnel
                                file. Employees should recognize the grave nature of the written warning.
                                &lt;/li&gt;
                                &lt;li&gt;
                                Performance improvement plan: Whenever an employee has been involved
                                in a disciplinary situation that has not been readily resolved or when he/she has
                                demonstrated an inability to perform assigned work responsibilities efficiently,
                                the employee may be given a final warning or placed on a performance improvement
                                (PIP). PIP status will last for a predetermined amount of time not to exceed 90 days.
                                Within this time period, the employee must demonstrate a willingness and ability
                                to meet and maintain the conduct and/or work requirements as specified by the
                                supervisor and the organization. At the end of the performance improvement period,
                                the performance improvement plan may be closed or, if established goals are not met,
                                dismissal may occur.
                                &lt;/li&gt;
                            &lt;/ul&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;
                                TAP|QA, LLC reserves the right to determine the appropriate level of discipline for
                                any inappropriate conduct, including oral and written warnings, suspension with or
                                without pay, demotion and discharge.
                            &lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;/article&gt;

                        &lt;h3 id="separation"&gt;Separation of Employment&lt;/h3&gt;
                        &lt;article&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;
                                Separation of employment within an organization can occur for several different reasons.
                            &lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;ul&gt;
                                &lt;li&gt;
                                Resignation: Although we hope your employment with us will be a mutually rewarding
                                experience, we understand that varying circumstances cause employees to voluntarily
                                resign employment. Resigning employees are encouraged to
                                provide two weeks’ notice, in writing, to facilitate a smooth transition out of
                                the organization. If an employee provides less notice than requested, the
                                employer may deem the individual to be ineligible for rehire depending on the
                                circumstances regarding the notice given.
                                &lt;/li&gt;
                                &lt;li&gt;
                                    Job abandonment: Employees who fail to report to work or contact their supervisor
                                    for three (3) consecutive workdays shall be considered to have abandoned the job
                                    without notice, effective at the end of their normal shift on the third day.
                                    The supervisor shall notify the Human Resources Department at the expiration of
                                    the third workday and initiate the paperwork to terminate the
                                    employee. Employees who are separated due to job abandonment are ineligible to
                                    receive accrued bene ts and are ineligible for rehire.
                                &lt;/li&gt;
                            &lt;/ul&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;
                                Termination: Employees of TAP|QA, LLC are employed on an at-will basis, and the
                                company retains the right to terminate an employee at any time.
                            &lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;/article&gt;

                        &lt;h3 id="return"&gt;Return of Company Property&lt;/h3&gt;
                        &lt;article&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;
                                The separating employee must return all company property at the time of separation,
                                including keys, computers, and identification cards. Failure to return some items may
                                result in deductions from the final paycheck.
                            &lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;
                                If applicable, any accrued PTO will be paid in the last paycheck. If the balance of
                                PTO is negative (or the employee used more PTO than was accrued), the negative
                                amount will be deducted from the employee’s last paycheck.
                            &lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;
                                If the employee has an outstanding expense report, they have one week following
                                their last day of employment with TAP|QA, LLC to turn in their report and
                                applicable receipts to be reimbursed.
                            &lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;
                                Health insurance terminates the last day of the month of employment, unless an
                                employee requests immediate termination of benefits. Information for Consolidated
                                Omnibus Budget Reconciliation (COBRA) continued health coverage will be provided.
                                Employees will be required to pay their share of the dependent health and dental
                                premiums through the end of the month.
                            &lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;/article&gt;

                                Former employees who left TAP|QA, LLC in good standing and were classified as
                                eligible for rehire may be considered for reemployment. An application must be
                                submitted to the recruiters, and the applicant must meet all minimum qualifications
                                and requirements of the position, including any qualifying exam, when required.
                                Recruiters must obtain approval from the Managing Partners or designee prior to
                                rehiring a former employee. Rehired employees begin benefits just as any other new
                                employee. Previous tenure will not be considered in calculating longevity,
                                leave accruals or any other benefits.
                            &lt;/p&gt;

                                identified drug use in the workplace. This policy applies to all employees and all
                                applicants for employment of TAP|QA, LLC. The Human Resources Department is
                                responsible for policy administration.

                                TAP|QA, LLC will assist and support employees who voluntarily seek help for such
                                problems before becoming subject to discipline and/or termination under this
                                or other policies. Such employees may be allowed to use accrued paid time off,

                                Such employees may be required to document that they are successfully following

                                are safety sensitive or that require driving or if they have violated this
                                policy previously.

                                to work safely and promptly, and disclose any work restrictions to their supervisor.
                                Employees should not, however, disclose underlying medical conditions unless directed to do so.

                            TAP|QA, LLC prohibits all employees from manufacturing, distributing, dispensing,

                        &lt;article&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;
                                TAP|QA, LLC defines bullying as “repeated inappropriate behavior, either direct or
                                indirect, whether verbal, physical or otherwise, conducted by one or more persons
                                against another or others, at the place of work and/or in the course of employment.”
                                Such behavior violates the company Code of Ethics, which clearly states that all
                                employees will be treated with dignity and respect.
                            &lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;
                                The purpose of this policy is to communicate to all employees, including supervisors,
                                managers and executives, that the company will not tolerate bullying behavior.
                                Employees found in violation of this policy will be disciplined up to and
                                including termination.
                            &lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;
                                Bullying may be intentional or unintentional. However, it must be noted that where
                                an allegation of bullying is made, the intention of the alleged bully is irrelevant
                                and will not be given consideration when meting out discipline. As in sexual
                                harassment, it is the e ect of the behavior upon the individual that is important.
                                TAP|QA, LLC considers the following types of behavior examples of bullying:
                            &lt;/p&gt;

                                    using a person as the butt of jokes; abusive and offensive remarks.
                                &lt;/li&gt;
                                &lt;li&gt;

                                    or threat of physical assault; damage to a person’s work area or property.

                                    in work-related activities.
                                &lt;/li&gt;

                                that may be dangerous to others.

                                When reporting a threat or incident of violence, the employee should be as specific
                                and detailed as possible. Employees should not place themselves in peril, nor
                                should they attempt to intercede during an incident.
                            &lt;/p&gt;

                                Employees should promptly inform the Human Resources Department of any protective
                                or restraining order that they have obtained that lists the workplace as a protected
                                area. Employees are encouraged to report safety concerns with regard to intimate

                                that is in violation of these guidelines will be subject to prompt disciplinary

                                employees for raising such concerns.
                            &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;
                                It is the responsibility of each employee to conduct all tasks in a safe and
                                efficient manner complying with all local, state and federal safety health
                                regulations and program standards, and with any special safety concerns for use
                                in a particular area or with a client.

                                Although most safety regulations are consistent throughout each client site and
                                contract, each employee has the responsibility to identify and familiarize
                                her/himself with the emergency plan for his/her working area.
                            &lt;/p&gt;

                                It is the responsibility of the employee to complete an Accident and Incident Report
                                for each safety and health infraction that occurs by an employee or that the employee
                                witnesses. Failure to report such an infraction may result in employee disciplinary
                                action, including termination.
                            &lt;/p&gt;

                                Furthermore, TAP|QA, LLC requires that every person in the organization assumes the
                                responsibility of individual and organizational safety. Failure to follow company
                                safety and health guidelines or engaging in conduct that places the employee,
                                client or company property at risk can lead to employee disciplinary action
                                and/or termination.
                            &lt;/p&gt;

                                It is the policy of TAP|QA, LLC to prohibit smoking on all company premises in
                                order to provide and maintain a safe and healthy work environment for all employees.
                                The law de nes smoking as the “act of lighting, smoking or carrying a lighted or
                                smoldering cigar, cigarette or pipe of any kind.”
                            &lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;The smoke-free workplace policy applies to:&lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;ul&gt;
                                &lt;li&gt;All areas of company office.&lt;/li&gt;
                                &lt;li&gt;All company-sponsored off-site conferences and meetings.&lt;/li&gt;
                                &lt;li&gt;All visitors (customers and vendors) to the company premises.&lt;/li&gt;
                            &lt;/ul&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;Smoking is permitted in parking lots only.&lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;
                                Employees who violate the smoking policy will be subject to disciplinary action up
                                to and including immediate discharge.
                            &lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;/article&gt;

                                Our clients and other parties with whom we do business entrust the company with
                                important information relating to their businesses. It is our policy that all
                                information considered confidential will not be disclosed to external parties or to
                                employees without a “need to know.” If an employee questions whether certain
                                information is considered confidential, he/she should  rst check with his/her
                                immediate supervisor. All computers, laptops, and client information must be
                                securely stored and locked up at the end of every day.
                            &lt;/p&gt;

                                This policy is intended to alert employees to the need for discretion at all
                                times and is not intended to inhibit normal business communications.

                                Employees must avoid any relationship or activity that might impair, or even appear
                                to impair, their ability to make objective and fair decisions when performing their
                                jobs. At times, an employee may be faced with situations in which business actions
                                taken on behalf of TAP/QA, LLC may con ict with the employee’s own personal interests.
                                All employees must disclose any possible con ict of interest prior to hire at
                                TAP|QA, LLC. Company property, information or business opportunities may not be
                                used for personal gain.

                                Conflicts of interest could arise in the following circumstances:

                                    Employees with a conflict-of-interest question should seek advice from
                                    management or Human Resources. Before engaging in any activity, transaction or
                                    relationship that might give rise to a con ict of interest, employees must seek
                                    review from their manager or the Human Resources Department.
                                &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;
                                Employees are permitted to engage in outside work or to hold other jobs,
                                subject to certain restrictions as outlined below.
                            &lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;
                                Activities and conduct away from the job must not compete with, conflict with or
                                compromise the company interests or adversely a ect job performance and the ability
                                to fulfill all job responsibilities. Employees are prohibited from performing any
                                services for customers on nonworking time that are normally performed by TAP|QA, LLC.
                                This prohibition also extends to the unauthorized use of any company tools or
                                equipment and the unauthorized use or application of any confidential information.
                                In addition, employees are not to solicit or conduct any outside business during
                                paid working time.
                            &lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;
                                Employees are cautioned to carefully consider the demands that additional work
                                activity will create before accepting outside employment. Outside employment
                                will not be considered an excuse for poor job performance, absenteeism,
                                tardiness, leaving early, refusal to travel or refusal to work overtime or different
                                hours. If TAP|QA, LLC determines that an employee’s outside work interferes with
                                performance, the employee may be asked to terminate the outside employment.
                            &lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;/article&gt;

                        &lt;article&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;
                                All employees are required to adhere to their client’s schedule of core hours.
                                Vacation and holidays must be scheduled with the client in advance. Patterns of
                                absenteeism or tardiness may result in discipline even if the employee has not yet
                                exhausted available paid time off. Absences due to illnesses or injuries that
                                qualify under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) will not be counted against
                                an employee’s attendance record. Medical documentation within the guidelines of the
                                FMLA may be required in these instances.
                            &lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;
                                Not reporting to work and not calling to report the absence is a no-call/no-show
                                and is a serious matter. The  rst instance of a no call/no show will result in a
                                final written warning. The second separate offense may result in termination of employment
                                with no additional disciplinary steps. A no call/no show lasting three days may
                                be considered job abandonment and may be deemed an employee’s voluntary resignation of employment.
                            &lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;/article&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;
                                It is important for all employees to project a professional image while at work by
                                being appropriately attired. TAP|QA, LLC employees are expected to be neat, clean
                                and well-groomed while on the job. Clothing must be consistent with the standards
                                for a business casual environment, and must be appropriate to the type of work being
                                performed. Beach, gym, and sporting attire is unacceptable to wear in any workplace.
                                Leggings, unless covered through mid-thigh by other appropriate clothing, are unacceptable.
                            &lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;
                                Natural and artificial scents may become a distraction from a well-functioning
                                workplace and are also subject to this policy with the exception of religious and
                                cultural reasons, facial and tongue piercings as well as facial tattoos are prohibited.
                            &lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;
                                TAP|QA, LLC is con dent that employees will use their best judgment regarding attire
                                and appearance. Management reserves the right to determine appropriateness. Any
                                employee who is improperly dressed will be counseled or in severe cases may be sent
                                home to change clothes. Continued disregard of this policy may be cause for
                                disciplinary action, which may result in termination.
                            &lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;/article&gt;

                                Employees are expected to demonstrate good judgment and professional taste while
                                on-site. Every client site may have different standards of work attire, and all
                                employees must adhere to their specific client site’s dress code. At a minimum,
                                employees must dress business casual for their first week at a new client.
                                Then, employees must match the dress code or dress one-step above the client.
                            &lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;/article&gt;

                                their current client’s core hours take precedence, and must be adhered to.
                                Consultants working with clients on either the East or West Coasts should adjust
                                their schedules to match the core hours set by their client.

                                and exercise care to avoid the appearance of impropriety. If a circumstance arises that
                                is not specifically covered in the travel policies, the most
                                course of action should be adopted.
                            &lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;
                                Travel for staff must be authorized in advance. Travelers should verify that planned
                                travel is eligible for reimbursement before making travel arrangements. Expenses for
                                travel are processed on a monthly basis (unless the contract specifies differently).
                                Expense reports and coinciding receipts should be submitted to the Financial/ Operations
                                no later than the first Friday of the month following the travel.
                            &lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;/article&gt;

                                 TAP|QA, LLC recognizes eight holidays each year:
                             &lt;/p&gt;
                             &lt;ul&gt;
                                 &lt;li&gt;New Year's Day&lt;/li&gt;
                                 &lt;li&gt;Memorial Day&lt;/li&gt;
                                 &lt;li&gt;Independence Day&lt;/li&gt;
                                 &lt;li&gt;Labor Day&lt;/li&gt;
                                 &lt;li&gt;Thanksgiving Day&lt;/li&gt;
                                 &lt;li&gt;Day After Thanksgiving&lt;/li&gt;
                                 &lt;li&gt;Christmas Eve&lt;/li&gt;
                                 &lt;li&gt;Christmas Day&lt;/li&gt;
                             &lt;/ul&gt;
                             &lt;p&gt;
                                 A client site may observe holidays that are not included on the list of holidays
                                 observed by TAP|QA, LLC. For example, a client may close its office to observe MLK Day.
                                 In this instance, a TAP|QA, LLC employee has three options:
                             &lt;ol&gt;
                                 &lt;li&gt;
                                     They may coordinate with their supervisor to arrange work, either on or off site
                                     during the holiday.
                                 &lt;/li&gt;
                                &lt;li&gt;
                                    They may coordinate with their supervisor to work 40 hours within a shorter week.
                                    For example, they may work four, ten-hour days.
                                &lt;/li&gt;
                                &lt;li&gt;
                                    If the employee does not work on the holiday, in this example, MLK Day, they will
                                    have to use 8 hours of PTO.
                                &lt;/li&gt;
                             &lt;/ol&gt;
                             &lt;/p&gt;
                         &lt;/article&gt;
                         &lt;h3 id="vacation"&gt;Vacation (As Applicable)&lt;/h3&gt;
                         &lt;article&gt;
                             &lt;p&gt;
                                 Salaried employees accrue PTO on a monthly basis. Employees are allowed to carry over
                                 up to five days (40 hours) of PTO at the end of the year. Any remaining PTO will
                                 be paid to the employee as a Billable Hours Bonus. TAP|QA, LLC allows its salaried
                                 employees to go negative in their PTO up to a balance of negative 40 hours. Any
                                 time off taken beyond negative 40 hours will be unpaid. To schedule vacation time,
                                 employees must first have their time off approved by their manager at the client site.
                                 Once approved, employees should send an email to Human Resources and Operations
                                 to notify them of their date of absence and return to work.
                             &lt;/p&gt;
                             &lt;p&gt;
                                 When submitting hours for time off, the employee should leave notes detailing their
                                 absence for the coinciding day(s) in Ebillity. If the time o  will equal one workweek
                                 or more, the employee must send an email to the Finance Department/Operations,
                                 informing them of the dates of departure and return to work.
                             &lt;/p&gt;
                             &lt;p&gt;
                                 For applicable employees, leave taken beyond an employee’s available vacation balance
                                 will result in a negative PTO balance. If separation of employment from TAP/ QA, LLC
                                 occurs before this balance returns to either zero or positive, the remaining negative
                                 balance will be deducted from the employee’s last paycheck.
                             &lt;/p&gt;
                         &lt;/article&gt;

                                 The function of this policy is to provide employees with a general description of their
                                 FMLA rights. In the event of any con ict between this policy and the applicable law,
                                 employees will be a orded all rights required by law.

                                 Under this policy, TAP|QA, LLC will grant up to 12 weeks (or up to 26 weeks of military
                                 caregiver leave to care for a covered service member with a serious injury or illness)
                                 during a 12-month period to eligible employees. The leave may be paid, unpaid or a
                                 combination of paid and unpaid leave, depending on the circumstances of the leave
                                 and as specified in this policy.
                             &lt;/p&gt;
                         &lt;/article&gt;
                         &lt;h3&gt;Eligibility&lt;/h3&gt;
                         &lt;article id="eligibility"&gt;
                             &lt;p&gt;
                                 To qualify to take family or medical leave under this policy, the employee must meet the following conditions:
                             &lt;/p&gt;
                             &lt;ul&gt;
                                 &lt;li&gt;
                                     The employee must have worked for the company for 12 months or 52 weeks.
                                     The 12 months or 52 weeks need not have been consecutive. Separate periods of
                                     employment will be counted, provided that the break in service does not exceed
                                     seven years. Separate periods of employment will be counted if the break in service
                                     exceeds seven years due to National Guard or Reserve military service obligations
                                     or when there is a written agreement, including a collective bargaining agreement,
                                     stating the employer’s intention to rehire the employee after the service break.
                                     For eligibility purposes, an employee will be considered to have been employed for
                                     an entire week even if the employee was on the payroll for only part of a week or
                                     if the employee is on leave during the week.
                                 &lt;/li&gt;
                                 &lt;li&gt;
                                     The employee must have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period
                                     immediately before the date when the leave is requested to commence. The principles
                                     established under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) determine the number of
                                     hours worked by an employee. The FLSA does not include time spent on paid or unpaid
                                     leave as hours worked. Consequently, these hours of leave should not be counted in
                                     determining the 1,250 hours eligibility test for an employee under FMLA.
                                 &lt;/li&gt;
                                 &lt;li&gt;
                                     The employee must work in a work site where 50 or more employees are employed by
                                     the company within 75 miles of that o ce or work site. The distance is to be
                                     calculated by using available transportation by the most direct route.
                                 &lt;/li&gt;
                             &lt;/ul&gt;
                         &lt;/article&gt;

                                 To qualify as FMLA leave under this policy, the employee must be taking leave for
                                 one of the reasons listed below:
                             &lt;/p&gt;

                                         This policy covers illnesses of a serious and long-term nature, resulting in
                                         recurring or lengthy absences. Generally, a chronic or long-term health condition
                                         that would result in a period of three consecutive days of incapacity with the
                                         first visit to the health care provider within seven days of the onset
                                         of the incapacity and a second visit within 30 days of the incapacity would be
                                         considered a serious health condition. For chronic conditions requiring periodic
                                         health care visits for treatment, such visits must take place at least twice a year.
                                         &lt;/p&gt;

                                 An eligible employee may take up to 12 weeks for the first five FMLA circumstances above
                                 (under heading “Type of Leave Covered”) under this policy during any 12-month period.
                                 The company will measure the 12-month period as a rolling 12-month period
                                 measured backward from the date an employee uses any leave under this policy.
                                 Each time an employee takes leave, the company will compute the amount of leave the
                                 employee has taken under this policy in the last 12 months and subtract it from the
                                 12 weeks of available leave, and the balance remaining is the amount of time the
                                 employee is entitled to take at that time.

                                 circumstance above during a single 12-month period. For this military caregiver leave,
                                 the company will measure the 12-month period as a rolling 12-month period measured
                                 forward. FMLA leave already taken for other FMLA circumstances will be deducted f
                                 rom the total of 26 weeks available.
                             &lt;/p&gt;

                                 wife may only take a combined total of 12 weeks of leave. If a husband and wife both
                                 work for the company and each wishes to take leave to care for a covered injured or
                                 ill service member, the husband and wife may only take a combined total of 26 weeks
                                 of leave.
                             &lt;/p&gt;

                                 While an employee is on leave, the company will continue the employee’s health benefits
                                 during the leave period at the same level and under the same conditions as if the
                                 employee had continued to work. Payment of the employee portion of the premium is
                                 still the responsibility of the employee, and must be arranged by the employee with
                                 the Finance Department/Operations.

                                 designated as FMLA leave and will run concurrently with FMLA.

                                 intermittently (take a day periodically when needed over the year) or, under certain
                                 circumstances, may use the leave to reduce the workweek or workday, resulting in a
                                 reduced-hour schedule. In all cases, the leave may not exceed a total of 12 workweeks
                                 (or 26 workweeks to care for an injured or ill service member over a 12-month period).

                                 All employees requesting FMLA leave must provide Human Resources with verbal or
                                 written notice of the need for the leave. When the need for the leave is foreseeable,
                                 the employee must provide the employer with at least 30 days’ notice. When an employee
                                 becomes aware of a need for FMLA leave less than 30 days in advance, the employee must
                                 provide notice of the need for the leave either the same day or the next business day.
                                 When the need for FMLA leave is not foreseeable, the employee must comply
                                 with the company’s usual and customary notice and procedural requirements for
                                 requesting leave (contact Human Resources). The employee will work with TAP|QA, LLC

                                 The company may require an employee on FMLA leave to report periodically on the
                                 employee’s status and intent to return to work.
