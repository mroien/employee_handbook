                                There are several things to keep in mind about this handbook. First, it contains only

                                all the possible applications of, or exceptions to, the general policies and procedures
                                described. For that reason, if you have any questions concerning eligibility for a
                                particular benefit or the applicability of a policy or practice to you, you should address
                                your specific questions to the Human Resources Department. Neither this handbook nor any

                                employment. Your employment is not for any specific time and may be terminated at will with
                                or without cause, and without prior notice by the company, or you may resign for any
                                reason at any time. No supervisor or other representative of the company
                                (except the Managing Partners) has the authority to enter into any agreement for employment
                                for any specified period of time or to make any agreement contrary to the above.</p>
                                <p>The procedures, practices, policies and benefits described here may be modified or discontinued

                            <article><p>
                                Sexual harassment constitutes discrimination and is illegal under federal, state and local laws.
                                For the purposes of this policy, sexual harassment is defined, as in the Equal Employment
                                Commission Guidelines, as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and other
                                verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when, for example a) submission to such conduct
                                is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual’s employment;
                                b) submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for
                                employment decisions affecting such individual; or c) such conduct has the purpose or effect
                                of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating,
                                hostile or offensive working environment. </p>
                                <p>Sexual harassment may include a range of subtle and not-so-subtle behaviors and may
                                involve individuals of the same or different gender. Depending on the circumstances,
                                these behaviors may include unwanted sexual advances or requests for sexual favors; sexual
                                jokes and innuendo; verbal abuse of a sexual nature; commentary about an individual’s
                                body, sexual prowess or sexual deficiencies; leering, whistling or touching; insulting
                                or obscene comments or gestures; display in the workplace of sexually suggestive objects
                                or pictures; and other physical, verbal or visual conduct of a sexual nature. </p>
                                <p>Harassment on the basis of any other protected characteristic is also
                                strictly prohibited. Under this policy, harassment is verbal, written or physical conduct
                                that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual because of his/her
                                race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, age, disability,
                                marital status, citizenship, genetic information or any other characteristic protected by
                                law or that of his/her relatives, friends or associates, and that a) has the purpose or
                                effect of creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment; b) has the
                                purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s work performance;
                                or c) otherwise adversely affects an individual’s employment opportunities.</p>
                                <p>Harassing conduct includes epithets, slurs or negative stereotyping; threatening,
                                intimidating or hostile acts; denigrating jokes; and written or graphic material
                                that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual or group and that
                                is placed on walls or elsewhere on the employer’s premises or circulated in the
                                workplace, on company time or using company equipment via e-mail, phone
                                (including voice messages), text messages, tweets, blogs, social networking sites or other means.</p>

                                These policies apply to all applicants and employees, whether related to conduct engaged
                                in by fellow employees or someone not directly connected to TAP/QA, LLC (e.g., an outside

                                <p>Conduct prohibited by these policies is unacceptable in
                                the workplace and in any work-related setting outside the workplace, such as during
                                business trips, business meetings and business-related social events.

                            <article><p>
                                Individuals who believe they have been the victims of conduct prohibited by this policy
                                statement or who believe they have witnessed such conduct should discuss their concerns
                                with their immediate supervisor, Human Resources or any member of management.</p>
                                <p>When possible, TAP/QA, LLC encourages individuals who believe they are being subjected to
                                such conduct to promptly advise the offender that his or her behavior is unwelcome and
                                request that it be discontinued. Often, this action alone will resolve the problem.
                                TAP/QA, LLC recognizes, however, that an individual may prefer to pursue the matter
                                through complaint procedures. </p>
                                <p>TAP|QA, LLC encourages the prompt reporting of complaints or concerns so that rapid
                                and constructive action can be taken before relationships become irreparably strained.
                                Therefore, although no  xed reporting period has been established, early reporting and
                                intervention have proven to be the most effective
                                method of resolving actual or perceived incidents of harassment.</p>
                                <p>Any reported allegations of harassment, discrimination or retaliation will be investigated promptly.
                                The investigation may include individual interviews with the parties involved and,
                                where necessary, with individuals who may have observed the alleged conduct or may have
                                other relevant knowledge.</p>
                                <p>Confidentiality will be maintained throughout the investigatory
                                process to the extent consistent with adequate investigation and appropriate corrective action.</p>
                                <p>Retaliation against an individual for reporting harassment or discrimination or for
                                participating in an investigation of a claim of harassment or discrimination is a serious
                                violation of this policy and, like harassment or discrimination itself, will be subject
                                to disciplinary action. Acts of retaliation should be reported immediately and will be
                                promptly investigated and addressed.</p>
                                <p>Misconduct constituting harassment, discrimination or retaliation will be dealt with
                                appropriately. </p>
                                <p>False and malicious complaints of harassment, discrimination or
                                retaliation may be the subject of appropriate disciplinary action.</p>

                                    poor work performance or misconduct. Our progressive discipline policy is designed
                                    to provide a corrective action process to improve and prevent a recurrence of
                                    undesirable behavior and/or performance issues. Our progressive discipline policy
                                    has been designed consistent with our organizational values, Human Resources best
                                    practices and employment laws.

                                    Outlined below are the steps of our progressive discipline policy and procedure.
                                    TAP|QA, LLC reserves the right to combine or skip steps in this process depending
                                    on the facts of each situation and the nature of the offense. The level of disciplinary
                                    intervention may also vary. Some of the factors that will be considered are as
                                    follows: whether the offense is repeated despite coaching, counseling and/or training;
                                    employee’s work record; and the impact the conduct and performance issues have
                                    on the organization.

                                    Verbal warning: A supervisor verbally counsels an employee about an issue of
                                    concern, and a written record of the discussion is placed in the employee’s personnel
                                    file for future reference.
                                    </li>

                                    Written warning: Written warnings are used for behavior or violations that a
                                    supervisor considers serious or in situations when a verbal warning has not helped
                                    change unacceptable behavior. Written warnings are placed in an employee’s personnel
                                    file. Employees should recognize the grave nature of the written warning.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                    Performance improvement plan: Whenever an employee has been involved
                                    in a disciplinary situation that has not been readily resolved or when he/she has
                                    demonstrated an inability to perform assigned work responsibilities efficiently,
                                    the employee may be given a final warning or placed on a performance improvement
                                    (PIP). PIP status will last for a predetermined amount of time not to exceed 90 days.
                                    Within this time period, the employee must demonstrate a willingness and ability
                                    to meet and maintain the conduct and/or work requirements as specified by the
                                    supervisor and the organization. At the end of the performance improvement period,
                                    the performance improvement plan may be closed or, if established goals are not met,
                                    dismissal may occur.

                                    Separation of employment within an organization can occur for several different reasons.
                                </p>

                                    Resignation: Although we hope your employment with us will be a mutually rewarding
                                    experience, we understand that varying circumstances cause employees to voluntarily
                                    resign employment. Resigning employees are encouraged to
                                    provide two weeks’ notice, in writing, to facilitate a smooth transition out of
                                    the organization. If an employee provides less notice than requested, the
                                    employer may deem the individual to be ineligible for rehire depending on the
                                    circumstances regarding the notice given.

                                        Job abandonment: Employees who fail to report to work or contact their supervisor
                                        for three (3) consecutive workdays shall be considered to have abandoned the job
                                        without notice, effective at the end of their normal shift on the third day.
                                        The supervisor shall notify the Human Resources Department at the expiration of
                                        the third workday and initiate the paperwork to terminate the
                                        employee. Employees who are separated due to job abandonment are ineligible to
                                        receive accrued bene ts and are ineligible for rehire.

                                    Termination: Employees of TAP|QA, LLC are employed on an at-will basis, and the
                                    company retains the right to terminate an employee at any time.

                                    The separating employee must return all company property at the time of separation,
                                    including keys, computers, and identification cards. Failure to return some items may
                                    result in deductions from the final paycheck.

                                    If applicable, any accrued PTO will be paid in the last paycheck. If the balance of
                                    PTO is negative (or the employee used more PTO than was accrued), the negative
                                    amount will be deducted from the employee’s last paycheck.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    If the employee has an outstanding expense report, they have one week following

                                    applicable receipts to be reimbursed.

                                    Health insurance terminates the last day of the month of employment, unless an
                                    employee requests immediate termination of benefits. Information for Consolidated

                                <p>
                                    TAP|QA, LLC defines bullying as “repeated inappropriate behavior, either direct or
                                    indirect, whether verbal, physical or otherwise, conducted by one or more persons
                                    against another or others, at the place of work and/or in the course of employment.”
                                    Such behavior violates the company Code of Ethics, which clearly states that all
                                    employees will be treated with dignity and respect.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The purpose of this policy is to communicate to all employees, including supervisors,
                                    managers and executives, that the company will not tolerate bullying behavior.
                                    Employees found in violation of this policy will be disciplined up to and
                                    including termination.

                                    Bullying may be intentional or unintentional. However, it must be noted that where
                                    an allegation of bullying is made, the intention of the alleged bully is irrelevant
                                    and will not be given consideration when meting out discipline. As in sexual
                                    harassment, it is the e ect of the behavior upon the individual that is important.

                                    Activities and conduct away from the job must not compete with, conflict with or
                                    compromise the company interests or adversely a ect job performance and the ability
                                    to fulfill all job responsibilities. Employees are prohibited from performing any
                                    services for customers on nonworking time that are normally performed by TAP|QA, LLC.
                                    This prohibition also extends to the unauthorized use of any company tools or
                                    equipment and the unauthorized use or application of any confidential information.
                                    In addition, employees are not to solicit or conduct any outside business during
                                    paid working time.

                                    Employees are cautioned to carefully consider the demands that additional work
                                    activity will create before accepting outside employment. Outside employment
                                    will not be considered an excuse for poor job performance, absenteeism,
                                    tardiness, leaving early, refusal to travel or refusal to work overtime or different
                                    hours. If TAP|QA, LLC determines that an employee’s outside work interferes with
                                    performance, the employee may be asked to terminate the outside employment.

                                    All employees are required to adhere to their client’s schedule of core hours.
                                    Vacation and holidays must be scheduled with the client in advance. Patterns of
                                    absenteeism or tardiness may result in discipline even if the employee has not yet
                                    exhausted available paid time off. Absences due to illnesses or injuries that
                                    qualify under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) will not be counted against
                                    an employee’s attendance record. Medical documentation within the guidelines of the
                                    FMLA may be required in these instances.

                                    Not reporting to work and not calling to report the absence is a no-call/no-show
                                    and is a serious matter. The  rst instance of a no call/no show will result in a
                                    final written warning. The second separate offense may result in termination of employment
                                    with no additional disciplinary steps. A no call/no show lasting three days may
                                    be considered job abandonment and may be deemed an employee’s voluntary resignation of employment.

                                    Employees will be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred in
                                    connection with approved travel on behalf of the company.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Travelers seeking reimbursement should incur the lowest reasonable travel expenses
                                    and exercise care to avoid the appearance of impropriety. If a circumstance arises that
                                    is not specifically covered in the travel policies, the most
                                    course of action should be adopted.
                                </p>

                                    Travel for staff must be authorized in advance. Travelers should verify that planned
                                    travel is eligible for reimbursement before making travel arrangements. Expenses for
                                    travel are processed on a monthly basis (unless the contract specifies differently).
                                    Expense reports and coinciding receipts should be submitted to the Financial/ Operations
                                    no later than the first Friday of the month following the travel.

                                     A client site may observe holidays that are not included on the list of holidays
                                     observed by TAP|QA, LLC. For example, a client may close its office to observe MLK Day.
                                     In this instance, a TAP|QA, LLC employee has three options:
                                 <ol>
                                     <li>
                                         They may coordinate with their supervisor to arrange work, either on or off site
                                         during the holiday.
                                     </li>
                                    <li>
                                        They may coordinate with their supervisor to work 40 hours within a shorter week.
                                        For example, they may work four, ten-hour days.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        If the employee does not work on the holiday, in this example, MLK Day, they will
                                        have to use 8 hours of PTO.
                                    </li>
                                 </ol>

                                     Salaried employees accrue PTO on a monthly basis. Employees are allowed to carry over
                                     up to five days (40 hours) of PTO at the end of the year. Any remaining PTO will
                                     be paid to the employee as a Billable Hours Bonus. TAP|QA, LLC allows its salaried
                                     employees to go negative in their PTO up to a balance of negative 40 hours. Any
                                     time off taken beyond negative 40 hours will be unpaid. To schedule vacation time,
                                     employees must first have their time off approved by their manager at the client site.
                                     Once approved, employees should send an email to Human Resources and Operations
                                     to notify them of their date of absence and return to work.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                     When submitting hours for time off, the employee should leave notes detailing their
                                     absence for the coinciding day(s) in Ebillity. If the time o  will equal one workweek
                                     or more, the employee must send an email to the Finance Department/Operations,
                                     informing them of the dates of departure and return to work.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                     For applicable employees, leave taken beyond an employee’s available vacation balance
                                     will result in a negative PTO balance. If separation of employment from TAP/ QA, LLC
                                     occurs before this balance returns to either zero or positive, the remaining negative
                                     balance will be deducted from the employee’s last paycheck.
                                 </p>

                                     To qualify to take family or medical leave under this policy, the employee must meet the following conditions:
                                 </p>
                                 <ul>

                                         The employee must have worked for the company for 12 months or 52 weeks.
                                         The 12 months or 52 weeks need not have been consecutive. Separate periods of
                                         employment will be counted, provided that the break in service does not exceed
                                         seven years. Separate periods of employment will be counted if the break in service
                                         exceeds seven years due to National Guard or Reserve military service obligations
                                         or when there is a written agreement, including a collective bargaining agreement,
                                         stating the employer’s intention to rehire the employee after the service break.
                                         For eligibility purposes, an employee will be considered to have been employed for
                                         an entire week even if the employee was on the payroll for only part of a week or
                                         if the employee is on leave during the week.

                                         The employee must have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period
                                         immediately before the date when the leave is requested to commence. The principles
                                         established under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) determine the number of
                                         hours worked by an employee. The FLSA does not include time spent on paid or unpaid
                                         leave as hours worked. Consequently, these hours of leave should not be counted in
                                         determining the 1,250 hours eligibility test for an employee under FMLA.

                                             This policy covers illnesses of a serious and long-term nature, resulting in
                                             recurring or lengthy absences. Generally, a chronic or long-term health condition
                                             that would result in a period of three consecutive days of incapacity with the
                                             first visit to the health care provider within seven days of the onset
                                             of the incapacity and a second visit within 30 days of the incapacity would be
                                             considered a serious health condition. For chronic conditions requiring periodic
                                             health care visits for treatment, such visits must take place at least twice a year.

                                     An eligible employee may take up to 12 weeks for the first five FMLA circumstances above
                                     (under heading “Type of Leave Covered”) under this policy during any 12-month period.
                                     The company will measure the 12-month period as a rolling 12-month period
                                     measured backward from the date an employee uses any leave under this policy.
                                     Each time an employee takes leave, the company will compute the amount of leave the
                                     employee has taken under this policy in the last 12 months and subtract it from the
                                     12 weeks of available leave, and the balance remaining is the amount of time the
                                     employee is entitled to take at that time.
                                 </p>

                                     An eligible employee can take up to 26 weeks for the FMLA military caregiver leave
                                     circumstance above during a single 12-month period. For this military caregiver leave,
                                     the company will measure the 12-month period as a rolling 12-month period measured
                                     forward. FMLA leave already taken for other FMLA circumstances will be deducted f
                                     rom the total of 26 weeks available.
                                 </p>

                                     parent (but not a parent “in-law”) with a serious health condition, the husband and
                                     wife may only take a combined total of 12 weeks of leave. If a husband and wife both
                                     work for the company and each wishes to take leave to care for a covered injured or
                                     ill service member, the husband and wife may only take a combined total of 26 weeks
                                     of leave.

                                     All employees requesting FMLA leave must provide Human Resources with verbal or
                                     written notice of the need for the leave. When the need for the leave is foreseeable,

                                     becomes aware of a need for FMLA leave less than 30 days in advance, the employee must
                                     provide notice of the need for the leave either the same day or the next business day.
