Absences due to illnesses or injuries that\r\n                                    qualify under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) will not be counted against\r\n                                    an employee’s attendance record. Medical documentation within the guidelines of the\r\n                                    FMLA may be required in these instances.\r\n                                </p>\r\n                                <p>\r\n                                    Not reporting to work and not calling to report the absence is a no-call/no-show\r\n                                    and is a serious matter.

Employees are allowed to carry over\r\n                                     up to five days (40 hours) of PTO at the end of the year. Any remaining PTO will\r\n                                     be paid to the employee as a Billable Hours Bonus. TAP|QA, LLC allows its salaried\r\n                                     employees to go negative in their PTO up to a balance of negative 40 hours. Any\r\n                                     time off taken beyond negative 40 hours will be unpaid. To schedule vacation time,\r\n                                     employees must first have their time off approved by their manager at the client site.\r\n                                     Once approved, employees should send an email to Human Resources and Operations\r\n                                     to notify them of their date of absence and return to work.\r\n                                 </p>\r\n                                 <p>\r\n                                     When submitting hours for time off, the employee should leave notes detailing their\r\n                                     absence for the coinciding day(s) in Ebillity.
